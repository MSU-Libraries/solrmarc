These jar files are used for building and testing the SolrMarc jar, they are a part of a previous version of Solr.

The jar names apache-solr-solrj-3.5-Multiversion.jar is a specially modified version of Solr's solrj library that can detect
detect the version of Solr you are communicating to, and tweak the transmission protocol slightly as-needed so that it 
can work with versions from Solr 1.3 through Solr 4.10.   If you are dealing with any of these older Solr version it may
be better to use this collection of jar files rather than tracking down the set included with that earlier version of Solr.
If you are using a newer version of Solr, you can merely reference the location of the Solrj libraries at run time, and 
the version of SolrMarc with load and use those libraries dynamically.
